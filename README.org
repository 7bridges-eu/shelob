* Shelob

  Shelob is a minimal wrapper around [[https://www.seleniumhq.org/][Selenium]].

** Rationale

   Selenium automates web browsing, primarily for testing and
   administration purposes.

   Shelob is a tiny wrapper to make it more idiomatic and adherent to the
   Clojure way of coding.

** Version

   [[https://clojars.org/shelob/latest-version.svg]]

** Example

   A simple DuckDuckGo search:
   + Type "clojure" on the search field
   + Click on the magnify glass to perform the search
   + Print the text of the first result

   #+begin_src clojure
     (require '[shelob.core :as shelob])

     (let [driver (shelob/go (shelob/web-driver) "https://duckduckgo.com")
           input-field (shelob/fill-by driver (shelob/by :id "search_form_input_homepage") "clojure")
           submit-button (shelob/click-by driver (shelob/by :id "search_button_homepage"))]
       (-> (shelob/find-element driver (shelob/by :id "r1-0"))
            shelob/text
            println))
   #+end_src
